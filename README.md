OpenIAB is an open source library which provides an easy way for the developers to develop their apps/games in a way that one APK will work in all the stores and automatically use the right in-app purchase API under each store. OpenIAB also provides an open in-app billing API that stores could implement to support all the built APK files using this library. Currently there are alreay 5 stores that support the Open API: Yandex.Store, SlideME, Appland, Aptoide and AppMall. The open stores don't need extra libraries to be included with your project, only OpenIAB is required to support all of them. 
OpenIAB supports the following stores:
*  Appland
*  Aptoide
*  AppMall
*  Google Play
*  Samsung Apps
*  SlideMe
*  Nokia Store
*  Yandex.Store
